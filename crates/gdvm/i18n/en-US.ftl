    If given, value overrides the default version set with "use". Otherwise, the default version is used. In other words, if you set a default version with "use --csharp", you can try to run the same version but without C# support with "run --csharp false". However, it may not work as expected if the version without C# support is not installed. (Just run "install" to install it.)

help-pin = Pin a version of Godot to the current directory.
help-pin-long = { help-pin }

    This will create a .gdvmrc file in the current directory with the pinned version. When you run "gdvm run" in this directory or any of its subdirectories, the pinned version will be used instead of the default version.

    This is useful when you want to use a specific version of Godot for a project without changing the default version system-wide.

    { help-run-force }

    If you do this, the requested or pinned version of Godot may overwrite the project file. If pinning versions, it is instead recommended to update the pinned version in .gdvmrc to match the project version, or remove the .gdvmrc file to use the project version.

  To resolve this, please create a personal access token on GitHub by visiting https://github.com/settings/tokens.

  Click "Generate new token", select only the minimal permissions required (e.g. public_repo), and then set the token via the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable or by running:

    gdvm config set github.token

  Note: The token will be stored in plaintext in your home directory. Please ensure you keep it secure.
  It is recommended to regularly review and rotate your tokens for security purposes.
